# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO
Persona 4: Midnight Clash

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO
A pixelated fighting game with Persona 4 characters. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO
I plan to make a fan game based on the original Persona 4 Golden game. I decided to have the visuals be pixelated to give the game a nostalgic feel, similar to an 8-bit game. This will be a single-player game. My software will allow users to select a character from the Persona 4 line up, then play as that character for one round in the arcade mode. Then after the round is done, they can change their character and location for the next round. As well as allow the player to change the background music if they wish to. The player will be able to change the location of the battle on the home menu, where the music selection is also present. Once the user has made all of their selections, they are all set to fight against an opponent from the character selection, in their selected battle environment.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable
Not applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable
Not applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO
A good outcome for my final project is to make sure that the visuals are clear and not hard to follow, and the controls are working, and are not a hindrance.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
A better outcome for my final project is to include multiple music tracks for background music, and include multiple locations for battle arenas.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
A best outcome for my final project is to learn more about Python by using all my knowledge of it on this project. As well as understand how to uses these concepts and apply them to my work, in order to build on the foundation of my understanding of Python and programming, and expand it into something more. But also to learn lots of software and coding skills that are reflected in my work.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO
My steps for my final project are as follows: gather information on the topic and original game, find proper visuals and designs to use as imports. Learn more about different game applications and websites to use to formulate this game, and turn my thought process into something that can be seen and followed. New skills that I will need to acquire are game frameworks, basic mathematical skills, sound integration, graphics, and to expand my knowledge on Python and game design principles. Topics that I'll need to research are game physics, game mechanics, pixel art and sprite design, game loops, and level design.
